         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> They are forbidden by our Lord, saying, <hi>When you pray, use not vain repetitions, Matth. 6.7.</hi> in which words, our Lord means not, <hi>the same Prayers repeated,</hi> (as is falsly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against the Prayers of the Church;) for thus our Lord prayed himself, <hi>Matth. 26.39, 44.</hi> Where his Prayer was short and three times repeated.</p>
                  <p>And therefore undoubtedly, by <hi>vain repetitions in Praying</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood multitude of words, and variety

                  <p>And that 'tis the meaning of our Lord, when he saith, <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pray ye,</hi> that our Prayers should be generally formed to the length of his Prayer prescribed, will appear</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36988:5"/>rather to seem, than really to be religious, loving the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

'Tis not hereby intended magisterially to impose upon any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, either at what hours they shall pray precisely in their Closets, or that they should thus, or thus punctually Meditate and Pray, at all such times, and upon every such subject prefixed: But</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> So many Psalms are added to every Chapter of Meditations, to
<pb facs="tcp:36988:8"/>recal, if possible, the Devotion of the present times, to the ancient and sure way of Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; which was, and is still by all sound and Orthodox Devota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in the devout use of the Psalms of <hi>David:</hi> 'twas thus that all the triumphing Saints in Heaven have prayed themselves thither, as far forth as their Religious practises appear unto us upon record in Ecclesiastical Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and 'tis a safe way to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their steps, rather than the fanciful conceptions of our own heads; especially remembring that it is acknowledged by all Christians, that the Psalms of <hi>David, are the Treasury of all Devotion:</hi> 'Tis known, that they are, and ever were, the constant Prayers of the Church and People of God at all times, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. It cannot be denyed, but that they are the immediate Dictates and Prayers of the holy and true Spirit of God; and therefore it must surely follow, that they are of higher dignity, greater efficacy and acceptation
<pb facs="tcp:36988:9"/>with God, than the most seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-zealous and pathetical expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Prayer, which flow from the spirit of the most learned and ready tongue'd man.</p>
                  <p>It is to be lamented even to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, at the madness and folly of many persons professing to be godly, that they do so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extol <hi>the Praying by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and yet altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the use of those <hi>Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual Songs,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Eph. 5.19. Col. 3.16.</hi> and are the infallible and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Prayers of the Spirit of Truth and Holiness: But 'tis the fond imaginations of their own hearts, that such do mean by the Spirit, if they blaspheme not; and 'tis these indigested conceptions of their own brain, which blinds their Zeal, and darkens their Ʋnderstanding, to slight both the Prayers of <hi>David,</hi> and of the Son of <hi>David</hi> also; even all the immediate Dictates of Heaven, when they come in competition with the conceived Notions of their own
<pb facs="tcp:36988:9"/>brain, which they call a <hi>praying by the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that you may truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>pray by the Spirit, and pray with the Understanding also;</hi> and, which is all one, <hi>you may sing with the Spirit, and sing with the Understanding also;</hi> (for the Psalms, whether said or sung, are the same Prayers, when they are rightly Translated) is the great reason of many Psalms paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and illustrated with Notes and Prayers: And these Psalms also are not of my own choice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to any of the ensuing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Meditation; but such as have been so selected and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, either by the Church of Christ, or some of the most eminent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Fathers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may take notice, that in the last Chapter of this <hi>PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN</hi> imprinted, are many of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heads, and hints of several

                        <p>Lord, I pray thee that thy Grace may alway prevent and follow me, and make me continually to be given unto all good works: which are the never failing fruits of a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith: and by these inseparably conjoyned to make my Calling and Election sure, sealed in the blood of my dear Redeemer.</p>

                        <p>Some persons are stifled in their mothers womb, and dye before they see the light of life: some dye in their Infancy, some in their youth, some in their mans estate: And some there be, but these are of all others the fewest in number, that dye in their old age: and yet most of men do not only desire, but fondly conceit they shall live to be old, and yet never think themselves old enough to dye, which makes so many millions of men dye unpreparedly, and so pass from a Temporal to death Eternal.</p>

                        <p>Lord, make me ever mindful of my latter end: that I may so live in thy fear, as to dye in thy favour, and a well grounded hope to live with thee for ever.</p>

                     <p>'Tis surely better by much not to feel by woful experience the miseries of the damned, than exactly to know, and accurately to discourse of them. And may this be ever my study, blessed Lord, my continual care, and fear, and constant endeavour not in the least particular to sin against thee: for thy wrath and indignation which resteth upon sinners, is a fierce wrath, and a terrible, 'tis not in the power of frail man to sustain the fury of it.</p>

                        <p>THe first, and 'tis esteemed by many holy Fathers the greatest of Hell Torments, is that which is call'd by Divines, <hi>The pain of Loss,</hi> whereunto the wicked of the world are sentenced in these several expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<note place="margin">Mat. 22.13 &amp; 25.30, 41. Luc. 13 27.</note>

                        <q>The Pains of Sense in hell, are intolerable (saith <hi>Chrys.</hi>) yet for a man to suffer a thousand Hells is less irksome,

                        </q>
                        <p>The Loss of Heaven must needs be the greatest of evils, because 'tis the Loss of the greatest and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good, and of all that is truly good.</p>

                        <p>In this life the most wise and holy understand not throughly the fulness of Heavenly joys, and so cannot be sensible of the torment of their Loss: but in the next life our eyes shall be opened, and the veil upon our hearts removed, and then shall the ungodly see, to their unspeakable grief and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of spirit the vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the never fading pleasures of the right hand of God, and the empty transitory pleasures of sin; betwixt that fulness of joy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and the deplorable sorrow of its loss and absence.</p>

                        <p>But though this be the guise of the multitude, to walk every one after the lusts of their own hearts, and to follow their own imaginations in the contempt of the Lords admonitions and commands,

                        <p>There is Fire indeed in Hell, but such a Fire as burns without shining, a Fire without light, not unlike whereunto is the fire of blind Zeal,

                        <p>OF all the torments invented and practised by the malice of men or devils, that by Fire is the most fierce and frightful: How does it amaze the minds of men, when they see it flaming in their houses, and consuming their habitations and estates? and yet <hi>the Fire of Hell</hi> is far more dreadful and tormenting, as differing from our ordinary fire especially in three respects.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Our fire feeds only upon gross and corporeal substances, but <hi>Hell fire</hi> feeds upon spirits and damned souls; and 'tis therefore as much more fierce and piercing than our fire, as a spirit is more quick and active, than a gross heavy body.</p>
                        <p>Be not deceived (O my Soul) with any fond conceits of vain men, that this fire is only metaphorical, or phantastical, or poetical, because 'tis prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are spirits, and not lyable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:36988:148"/>to visible flames: But the word of God which cannot lye, and many undeniable reasons by the learned deduced thence, do confirm it to be a real, yea a material fire,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.12, ca. 13.42. ca. 25.41. Mar. 9.43 47. Mat. 3 12, Isa. 66. <hi>ult</hi> Isa. 30. <hi>ult.</hi>
                           </note> but more spiritual and refined, and so more eating, piercing and tormenting than the fire which burns upon our hearts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our fire may be quenched, nay 'twill quench it self when its fuel is wasted: but the fire of Hell is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable:</hi> because First, The breath of the everlasting God like a stream of Brimstone doth enkindle it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The fuel that feeds this fire shall never be consumed, <hi>viz.</hi> Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, immortal Beings, of whom being tormented in these flames 'tis affirmed, that <hi>they shall seek death,
<note place="margin">Rev. 9.6.</note> and shall not find it, they shall desire to dye, but death shall fly from them.</hi> Miserable wretches! whilst they had time and leisure to seek life, they neglected it; nay it is too common, that when life in Christ is offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many in the blessed food of their Souls, they slight and contemn it,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ʋt cujus vita mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua fuit in culpa, illic mors vivat in poena.</hi> Greg.</note> and therefore 'tis most just as the Father observes, that <hi>they whose life in this world was no other than a death in sin,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:36988:149"/>their death hereafter should be a life in punishment for sin everlastingly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But as to the unquenchable fire of Hell, Remember (O my Soul) that there is now a fire within thee, the which if it be not quencht in this life, will bring thee to fire unquenchable in the other world: and this is the rank and fulsome fire of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence. Thy carnal lusts, and thy worldly lusts being now followed and fulfilled, are the fuel that feeds that dismal fire of the infernal lake: and <hi>the Worm also that never dieth,</hi> is bred of the same corruption, even in the dunghil lusts of the heart, actuated by the hot suggestions of Sathan.</p>
                        <p>And as the fire of concupiscence doth now more or less rage in thy heart, so as to follow the sway there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; so shall the fire of hell be, more or less raging hereafter, if these lusts do not dye within thee, before the death of nature seize thee.</p>
                        <p>Take then the advice of the wise <hi>Syracides,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.17.</note> Humble thy self greatly, for the vengeance of the wicked is fire and worms.</hi> And of S. <hi>Paul:
<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> Mortifie therefore your members that

                        </p>
                        <p>Blessed Jesus, by the merits and mysteries of thy Circumcision I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg the true Circumcision of the spirit: and by the virtue of thy Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion strengthen me to crucifie the flesh with the affections and lusts, lest any of those exorbitant fires being not opportunely quenched, involve me in those flames of hell which are unquenchable.</p>

                        <q>WHen I consider righteous <hi>Job</hi> on the dunghil,
<note place="margin">Greg. mor.</note> the holy <hi>Baptist</hi> hungring in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, S. <hi>James</hi> beheaded, S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> crucified, the Torments and deaths of innumerable Martyrs, the manifold afflictions of the holy and elect people of God, I cannot
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:36988:150"/>but consider and know assuredly that very great and many shall be the torments of the wicked in the world to come: since God suffereth those whom he dearly loves to be so much afflicted in this life.</q>
                        <p>The Pains of Hell in the extent of them do herein differ from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bodily pains: that these are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial only in some particular parts, joynts and members of the body, whilst other parts are free from pain: But in Hell the whole man in all the senses internal and external, in all the parts of his body and powers of his soul, yea the most spiritual faculties shall be tormented with Fire and Brimstone, rage and despite, grief and anguish, misery and malediction. The pains of Hell are a concourse of all kinds of pain, and of all at the same time, and of all of them for ever.</p>
                        <p>The Taste shall be punished with bitterness, the Appetite with hunger, and the Tongue with thirst, the Sight with horror, the Hearing with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, the Smell with stench, the Heart with anguish, the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with fear, the Reason with
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:36988:150"/>madness, the Judgment with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and in the very Bowels fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.</p>
                        <p>And this is most just, that as the wicked have employed all the powers and parts both of Soul and Body, as weapons of unrighteousness unto sin; so should their punishment be in all their senses, members, faculties — that as each hath transgrest by sinful pleasure, and inordinate delight, so each should have its peculiar afflicting torment.</p>
                        <p>'Tis undoubtedly true, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons condemned to the flames of the nether hell are not equally tormented therein: for though the fire of hell be one and the same, yet it torments not all after the same manner, nor in the same degree of torture: but every man shall therein more or less feel the smart of its fury, as by the nature, quality and frequency of his sin, he hath less or more deserved the same:
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.25</note> for <hi>shall not the Judge of all the world do right?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The more high, peremptory and presumptuous, as also the less obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and impenitent sinner shall both suffer under the torment of the same
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:36988:151"/>fire, but not in the same degree of pain and suffering: But alas the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree of suffering in that place of horror is punishment enough, if seriously considered, to affright the sinner from all the errors of his ways.</p>
                        <p>There be many who now think this or that to be severe commands, <hi>Love your enemies— Deny thy self, Fast, and Watch and Pray— Take up thy Cross—</hi> but surely 'twill be much more hard and bitter to hear,
<note place="margin">Tho. à Kemp.</note>
                           <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye cursed into everlasting fire—</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>O let not then the severest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Gospel, nor the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and labors of Repentance star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and affright thee: let not the breach or neglect thereof, seem a light and a small thing unto thee; but Remember that to endure the pains of Hell but one hour, is more exceeding painful and afflicting, than a thousand years of the most strict, and severe austerities in Fasting and Sackcloth and Ashes.</p>
                        <p>Here, blessed Lord, here in this life let me be punished for my sins, but spare, O spare me in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:36988:151"/>life to come, and from those intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pains of the nether Hell, good Lord deliver me through Jesus Christ.</p>

                           <p>I do profess to love God, and do desire that my heart may be every day more and more inflamed with the same fire of his love: but doubtless I must have withal a due regard and veneration for his Saints; for as God is praised in his Saints, so is he disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in their disrespect,

                        <p>But the good things of Heaven are durable, permanent and lasting, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto shall no Time succeed, no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follow.</p>
                        <q>The <hi>Glory</hi> of them that dye in <hi>Grace,</hi> is Immortal,
<note place="margin">Eus. nirier.</note> their Happiness Immutable; their Crown immar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible; their Life everlasting; and their Raign with God, and the Lamb for ever and ever. No day does pass with these blessed Souls, without its fulness of joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: This joy shall be ever new and yet ever the same: This glory shall never wither or decay, but flourish for perpetual eternities.</q>
                        <p>And this must needs be joy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause celestial joy consists as in the blissful vision of God, so in an assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation to him: for just men made perfect, are immutable in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and felicity by beholding him who is unchangeable: so the Apostle,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:36988:172"/>
                           <hi>We all as in a Glass, beholding the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18</note> are changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Moon and the Stars receive their light from the Sun, and become like unto him, by being opposite, and in a sort beholding the Suns bright face: So the pure Souls in Heaven by seeing God who is the Light of lights, are from him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and made like unto him. So saith the beloved Apostle: <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know when he shall appear, we shall be made like him, for we shall see him as he is:</hi> And that is not as now <hi>in a glass darkly,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> but face to face, i.e.</hi> as fully as our measure will contain, our proportion bear, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Grace require.</p>
                        <p>That the inheritance of Heaven is for ever, is manifest from the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its purchase: it cost no less than the precious blood of the Son of God: how then shall that life of Glory ever fail or fade away, since the Lord of life himself vouchsafed to dye for its acquisition and purchase?</p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:36988:172"/>
                        <q>The joyes of Heaven (saith <hi>Gran.</hi>)
<note place="margin">Gra. medit.</note> shall continue as many Millions of years as there are Stars in the Firmament, and many more: They shall last as many hundred millions of years as there have been drops of Rain faln from Heaven since the beginning of the world, and more, much more: In a word, they shall endure as long as there is a God in Heaven, and this God the same which was, which is, and which is to come, from everlasting to everlasting.</q>
                        <p>Shall not then my heart be fixed where such lasting joyes are to be found? And thither my heart must first be sent by way of Harbinger, before my person can arrive there: I must now have my conversation in Heaven, before I can have my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation there: I must now be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded, or else never hope to be admitted into the joys of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>But O the heavy burden of my sins! These do depress and weigh down the mind, and make her affections grovel in the dust: And yet even these shall not hinder thy ascent into Heaven, if thou tread them under thy

                     <p>THere is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Soul and Body in the dignity of their nature: the Soul is of a heavenly descent and original; but the body is of earthly mould and making: the Soul is framed by the hands of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after his own Image; but the Body is begotten of earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, after the likeness of sinful flesh: the Soul is of the same nature with the Angels of Heaven; but
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:36988:181"/>the Body is of kind and constitution with the beasts of the earth: the Soul being the infusion of Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the beauties and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the most high and holy God; but the Body being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of carnal copulation, assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates only the fading shadows of beauty in irrational beings: Lastly, whatever beauty, strength, motion or Life it self the Body enjoys, is by the vertue, vigor, and actuation of the Soul which manifests its immortality, and separate subsistence from the dying Body.</p>
                     <p>Very pertinent then is that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> to fond sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less man: <hi>Laboras ut non moriatur homo meriturus: &amp; non laboras nè peccet in aeternum victurus?</hi> Why art thou so solicitous to preserve the body from death, which must dye, and dost not endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preserve from sin thy Soul which will live for ever?</p>
                     <p>If but a finger of the Body ach, 'tis bemoaned and lapt, and every petty sore is salv'd, and carefully kept from the least touch, that may
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:36988:182"/>annoy it: and to cure the diseases of the Body no cost or pains is spar'd, the most bitter drugs are swallowed; lancing, burning, fasting, any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or torture is willingly endur'd: but the sores of sin are suffered to fester, and the diseases of the Soul are slighted, without any regard had to the devout use of those holy means, which the great Physician of Souls hath prescribed for their recovery.</p>
                     <p>O remember, and wisely consider, that by how much thy Soul transcends thy Body in purity of nature, and dignity of condition, by so much thy spiritual diseases are more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and destructive, than any bodily distempers can be.</p>
                     <p>The ilness of the Body tends only to the disanimation of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flesh: but the maladies of the Soul render her both loathsome in the eyes of God, and all good men, and also obnoxious to the Second death, the unsupportable torments of the nether hell.</p>

                        <hi>I am a sojourner upon earth as all my fathers were,</hi> O pierce my soul with the dart of divine love, to bewail the deadness of my affections towards thee, to lament that I am so much a stranger to my native home of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that my heart is not surely fixed there where true joys are to be found, but grovels in the dust of worldly vanities; to grieve that I walk in the midst of manifold temptations, and my ghostly enemies do dayly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against me, and dayly cast in my teeth my dayly backslidings from the love, and service of my God: <hi>But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord:
<note place="margin">Ps. 41.10.</note> Raise thou me up again, and I shall reward them,</hi> by my future conquests over all their temptations.</p>

                     <head>MEDITATION <hi>Of the dwelling of God in the hearts of his People.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHosoever desires that the Lord would vouchsafe to come unto him, must himself first prepare his heart to come unto God: And this not by Faith alone, but by divine love, and obedience to his most holy Laws: <hi>If any man love me he will keep my Sayings,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.23.</note> and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How, and when the Lord comes, and abides with us, must be known by the influences and operations of his presence, as the tree by its fruits, or the cause by its effects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>God is light, and in him is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darkness at all:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note> and such are the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Souls in whom he abides,
<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.5.</note>
                        <hi>they are all children of the light, and of the day, not of night, and of darkness:</hi> Their understandings are enlightned to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:36988:185"/>know God, both in himself, and in the ways of his service, and of their own Salvation: and this light of their Faith shines before men, in all the good works of Soberness, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Godliness to the glory of God the father of lights.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>God is a consuming fire:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Souls possessed by him are purged as with fire from all the sordid lusts of the flesh, and of the world, their affections are purified, the rust of sloth and negligence in the ways of life is scowred off, their hearts as with fire are inflamed with the sacred ardors of divine Love, of a holy and discreet Zeal, of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Devotion in their Prayers unto God, and praises of him, and with earnest defires of a nearer, and a more immediate Communion with his divine Majesty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>God is the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and accordingly where he dwells,
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> he does allay the heat of carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, subdue the inordinate love of riches, quench the fire of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:36988:186"/>strife and contention, of blind Zeal and Faction, and of every exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant lust: being in himself a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all the vast desires of the immortal Soul.</p>
                     <p>As water he satisfieth the desires of all who hunger, and thirst after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and by the influence of his divine grace, makes the barren ground of the heart to be fruitful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every good word and work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God is all purity and holiness, goodness and mercy, justice and truth; and in a word, the summary of all perfection and felicity: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all those happy Souls where he dwells, are holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure, merciful as he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, just and good, gracious and long-suffering; and in a word, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as our heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p>'Tis such divinely enspirited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and only such can say with the heavenly inspired Psalmist: <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my defence, my Saviour, my God, and my might,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:36988:186"/>in whom I will trust, my buckler and the horn of my salvation, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> Psal. 18.1. <hi>and</hi> Psal. 27.1. <hi>The Lord is my light, and my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom then shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom then shall I be afraid? and</hi> Psal. 28.8. <hi>The Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart hath trusted in him and I am helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise him— The Lord is my strength, and he is the wholsom defence of his anointed— O save thy people, and give thy blessing to thine inheritance, feed them, and set them up for ever.</hi>
